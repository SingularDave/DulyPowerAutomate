This API finds matching requests for staffing needs across different clinics and notifies the managers via email.

Managers can submit requests by making a POST request to the /clinic-requests endpoint with a payload in the following format:

```json
{
  "body": [
    {
      "manager_name": "Jane Doe",
      "manager_email": "jane@clinic.com",
      "clinic": {"Value": "Addison"},
      "request_type": {"Value": "Needs a Tech"},
      "start_datetime": "2022-05-17T09:00:00Z",
      "end_datetime": "2022-05-17T17:00:00Z"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The API will then:

1. Check if any of the requests overlap in time
2. Check if the clinics are nearby using a predefined dictionary
3. Check if the request types match using another dictionary
4. If a match is found, an email is generated and returned in the response with the managers' email addresses and email template.

For example:
```json
{
  "Matching requests": [
    {
      "manager_email": "jane@clinic.com",
      "last_manager_email": "john@clinic.com",
      "email_template": "<email template>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Otherwise an empty list is returned.

The code contains input validation to ensure that only valid request objects are created.
